    "\n",
    "Research literature review represents a significant time investment in R&D, with studies showing that researchers spend 30-50% of their time reading, analyzing, and synthesizing academic papers. This challenge is universal across the research community. While thorough literature review is crucial for advancing science and technology, the current process remains inefficient and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key challenges include:\n",
    "- Extensive time commitment (30-50% of R&D hours) dedicated to reading and processing papers\n",
    "- Inefficient search processes across fragmented database ecosystems\n",
    "- Complex task of synthesizing and connecting findings across multiple papers\n",
    "- Resource-intensive maintenance of comprehensive literature reviews\n",
    "- Ongoing effort required to stay current with new publications"

Reinforcement Learning (RL), a\\ncomplementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex\\nbehaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective\\nreward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks\\nwhere sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate\\ndesign. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex\\nHumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,\\na pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language\\ntask descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated\\nenvironments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance\\nfeasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,\\ncreating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable\\ntext into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive\\nsimulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an\\nABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.\\nTasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04280v1\\n\\n-----\\n* Title: Pretrained LLMs as Real-Time Controllers for Robot Operated Serial\\n  Production Line\\n* Published Date: 2025-03-05T20:43:49Z\\n* Authors: Muhammad Waseem, Kshitij Bhatta, Chen Li, Qing Chang\\n* Abstract: The manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by\\ncutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, and cloud computing. Despite these\\nadvancements, effective system control, which is crucial for optimizing\\nproduction efficiency, remains a complex challenge due to the intricate,\\nknowledge-dependent nature of manufacturing processes and the reliance on\\ndomain-specific expertise. Conventional control methods often demand heavy\\ncustomization, considerable computational resources, and lack transparency in\\ndecision-making. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, as a straightforward, adaptable\\nsolution for controlling manufacturing systems, specifically, mobile robot\\nscheduling. We introduce an LLM-based control framework to assign mobile robots\\nto different machines in robot assisted serial production lines, evaluating its\\nperformance in terms of system throughput. Our proposed framework outperforms\\ntraditional scheduling approaches such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS),\\nShortest Processing Time (SPT), and Longest Processing Time (LPT).

However, aligning system behavior with user preferences\\nis challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward\\nfunctions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges\\nthrough an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent,\\ninter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human\\nfeedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our\\napproach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision\\navoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm\\npolicies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining\\nfairness and performance consistency.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03796v1\\n\\n-----\\n* Title: Persuasion at Play: Understanding Misinformation Dynamics in\\n  Demographic-Aware Human-LLM Interactions\\n* Published Date: 2025-03-03T20:30:22Z\\n* Authors: Angana Borah, Rada Mihalcea, Ver\\u00f3nica P\\u00e9rez-Rosas\\n* Abstract: Existing challenges in misinformation exposure and susceptibility vary across\\ndemographic groups, as some populations are more vulnerable to misinformation\\nthan others. Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these\\nchallenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and\\nreinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional\\npersuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative\\ncontent. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and\\nassess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments.\\nAdditionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of\\nmisinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our\\nfindings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to\\nmisinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen\\nin human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic\\ngroups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores\\nthe interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in\\nthe context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02038v1\\n\\n-----\\n* Title: Improving Retrospective Language Agents via Joint Policy Gradient\\n  Optimization\\n* Published Date: 2025-03-03T12:54:54Z\\n* Authors: Xueyang Feng, Bo Lan, Quanyu Dai, Lei Wang, Jiakai Tang, Xu Chen, Zhenhua Dong, Ji-Rong Wen\\n* Abstract: In recent research advancements within the community, large language models\\n(LLMs) have sparked great interest in creating autonomous agents. However,\\ncurrent prompt-based agents often heavily rely on large-scale LLMs. Meanwhile,\\nalthough fine-tuning methods significantly enhance the capabilities of smaller\\nLLMs, the fine-tuned agents often lack the potential for self-reflection and\\nself-improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel agent\\nframework named RetroAct, which is a framework that jointly optimizes both\\ntask-planning and self-reflective evolution capabilities in language agents.\\nSpecifically, we develop a two-stage joint optimization process that integrates\\nimitation learning and reinforcement learning, and design an off-policy joint\\npolicy gradient optimization algorithm with imitation learning regularization\\nto enhance the data efficiency and training stability in agent tasks. RetroAct\\nsignificantly improves the performance of open-source models, reduces\\ndependency on closed-source LLMs, and enables fine-tuned agents to learn and\\nevolve continuously. We conduct extensive experiments across various testing\\nenvironments, demonstrating RetroAct has substantial improvements in task\\nperformance and decision-making processes.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01490v1\\n\"\n",

Existing\\nspeech-enabled LLMs often degrade conversational quality by modifying the LLM,\\nthereby compromising its linguistic capabilities. In contrast, we propose\\nLLMVoX, a lightweight 30M-parameter, LLM-agnostic, autoregressive streaming TTS\\nsystem that generates high-quality speech with low latency, while fully\\npreserving the capabilities of the base LLM. Our approach achieves a\\nsignificantly lower Word Error Rate compared to speech-enabled LLMs, while\\noperating at comparable latency and UTMOS score. By decoupling speech synthesis\\nfrom LLM processing via a multi-queue token streaming system, LLMVoX supports\\nseamless, infinite-length dialogues. Its plug-and-play design also facilitates\\nextension to various tasks with different backbones. Furthermore, LLMVoX\\ngeneralizes to new languages with only dataset adaptation, attaining a low\\nCharacter Error Rate on an Arabic speech task. Additionally, we have integrated\\nLLMVoX with a Vision-Language Model to create an omni-model with speech, text,\\nand vision capabilities, without requiring additional multimodal training.

However, the equally\\ncritical aspect of generating long-form outputs has received comparatively less\\nattention. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in NLP research toward\\naddressing the challenges of long-output generation. Tasks such as novel\\nwriting, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require models to understand\\nextensive contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich, and logically\\nconsistent extended text. These demands highlight a critical gap in current LLM\\ncapabilities. We underscore the importance of this under-explored domain and\\ncall for focused efforts to develop foundational LLMs tailored for generating\\nhigh-quality, long-form outputs, which hold immense potential for real-world\\napplications.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04723v1\\n\\n-----\\n* Title: Enough Coin Flips Can Make LLMs Act Bayesian\\n* Published Date: 2025-03-06T18:59:23Z\\n* Authors: Ritwik Gupta, Rodolfo Corona, Jiaxin Ge, Eric Wang, Dan Klein, Trevor Darrell, David M. Chan\\n* Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to generalize given few-shot\\nexamples in their input prompt, an emergent capability known as in-context\\nlearning (ICL). We investigate whether LLMs utilize ICL to perform structured\\nreasoning in ways that are consistent with a Bayesian framework or rely on\\npattern matching. Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find\\nthat: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in\\nzero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias\\ninstructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with\\ndeviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates,\\nand (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With\\nsufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their\\npriors in a Bayesian manner.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04722v1\\n\\n-----\\n* Title: Predictable Scale: Part I -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large\\n  Language Model Pretraining\\n* Published Date: 2025-03-06T18:58:29Z\\n* Authors: Houyi Li, Wenzheng Zheng, Jingcheng Hu, Qiufeng Wang, Hanshan Zhang, Zili Wang, Yangshijie Xu, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, Daxin Jiang\\n* Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse\\ntasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates\\ncareful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies\\ninvolving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal\\nscaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a\\npower-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal\\nbatch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex\\noptimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size\\nconditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We\\ncontribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the\\ncommunity. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.07\\\\% away from the\\nglobally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws\\ndemonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training\\ndata distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work\\nthat unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts\\nmodels and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter\\nscaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization\\nprocess demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one\\nmillion NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and\\nhyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in\\ntotal. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will\\nprogressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our\\ndesignated repository https://step-law.github.io/\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715v1\\n\\n-----\\n* Title: Universality of Layer-Level Entropy-Weighted Quantization Beyond Model\\n  Architecture and Size\\n* Published Date: 2025-03-06T18:54:32Z\\n* Authors: Alireza Behtash, Marijan Fofonjka, Ethan Baird, Tyler Mauer, Hossein Moghimifam, David Stout, Joel Dennison\\n* Abstract: We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends\\nthe limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods\\nfor Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By\\nanalyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines\\nwhich blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance\\ndegradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms\\nuniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language\\nUnderstanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while\\nreducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ\\nacross multiple architectures-from 1.6B to 70B parameters-showcasing consistent\\nimprovements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or\\narchitectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce\\nperplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of\\nbeneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This\\nimprovement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental\\nrelationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements.\\nAdditionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution\\nanalysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique\\nleverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across\\nvarious architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization\\ndecisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy\\nanalysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be\\ndeveloped independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes,\\nopening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.\\n* Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04704v1\\n\"\n",

Using a standardized query - \"Find 8 papers on quantum machine learning\" - we evaluated performance across key metrics including response time, metadata quality, and academic value. Our analysis reveals distinct trade-offs: while our agent takes longer to process (30s vs. 2-5s), it provides significantly more detailed metadata, validated sources, and structured academic output. The comparison table above breaks down these differences across multiple dimensions, helping users choose the right tool for their specific research needs - whether it's quick exploration (where Copilot excels) or deep academic research (where our agent shows its strengths)."
